# Freenote
Free note was created by and Â©2017 Adrian Price.

Freenote aims to be a FOSS alternative to products like Evernote and Keep. The
basic note-taking functionality is extended with features that suit the power
user, such as Markdown support and integration with popular editors like Atom,
Sublime, and vim.

Freenote is made up of two executables; `freenote` and `freenoted`. `freenoted`
is the server executable; it exposes a REST API and web GUI for interacting with
it. `freenote` is a simple command-line tool for working with the REST API from
local applications like Atom or vim.
